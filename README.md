## What are we going to implement?
>Given that a user opens the application in the browser
>When the images are displayed on the screen

## Stretch Goal: Add Interaction

>As a user, I want to be able to interact with each item on the page.

>Given that a user clicks on an item other than the horned beasts, such as the title of the page or the footer, the information and styles should change.

## How are we implementing it?
>When the user clicks on elements such as the header, footer or title of page, make something change using state.
>You can update the words, change the styles or add something new. Be creative.
