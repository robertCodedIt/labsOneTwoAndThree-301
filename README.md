# labsOneTwoAndThree-301
this is the project covered in labs one two and three of code 301: Horned Beasts
Your App component should render a Header, Footer and Main component, each of which is defined in their own files.

<!-- Your Header component needs to have an <h1> with a title. -->

<!-- Your Footer component needs to contain your name as the author.   -->

 TODO: The Main component needs to render at least two copies of a component called HornedBeasts.

TODO:The Main component needs to pass title, imageUrl, and description into each HornedBeast component. For the purpose of todayâ€™s lab, you can pass whatever title, url and description that you want into each HornedBeast commponent.

TODO  The HornedBeast component needs to contain an <h2> that displays the title of the animal, an <img> element with src, alt and title attributes, and a <p> that displays the description.

NOTE: Rendering an image in React is tricky. Try to figure out how to do this on your own and we will go over it tomorrow
